# Statistical-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Solar-Energy

This repository contains the project "Statistical Analysis and Forecasting of Solar Energy - Inter States" completed in the partial fulfillment of the course Applied Statistical Methods.

## Project Objectives

The aim of the project is to analyse solar energy in 4 different states and to train an appropriate time series model for solar energy forecasting.

## Methodology :

## Time Series Model Validation :

This is forecasting obtained from SARIMA (1,1,1)(1,1,1,52) with a 95% confidence interval.
